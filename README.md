# FunnyCalc
A calculator that does math... and sometimes roasts you for asking it to. Built in Python for fun and learning.

A minimal console calculator built in Python — simple, functional, and a little too honest for its own good.  
It adds numbers, cracks jokes, and occasionally questions your intelligence (all in good humor, of course).

This project started as a fun way to learn Python while keeping things entertaining.  

If it makes you laugh, mission accomplished ✅

## ✨ Features
- Does basic addition (with attitude).
- Random jokes and sarcastic comments.
- Works entirely in the console.
- Lightweight and portable — just Python and bad manners required.

## 📦 HOW TO USE

Everything you need is inside the **FunnyCalc.zip** file.

1️⃣ Download the .ZIP from this repository.
  
2️⃣ Extract it anywhere on your computer.
  
3️⃣ You’ll find two files inside:

   - `FunnyCalc.py` → the original Python source code  
   - `FunnyCalc.exe` → the ready-to-run executable  

---

### 🐍 Option 1 — Run the Python Script  
If you already have Python installed, just open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:

```bash
python FunnyCalc.py
```


### 💾 Option 2 — Use the Executable (.exe)

If you don’t have Python installed, don’t worry!
You can run the calculator directly by double-clicking the FunnyCalc.exe file.
It’s exactly the same as the .py version — just pre-packed for convenience.

#### ⚠️ About the Executable (.exe)

When opening FunnyCalc.exe, Windows may show a warning saying the file is “risky” or from an unknown publisher.

##### ✅ Don’t worry — this is normal for self-made programs. The executable is completely safe and identical to the Python script.

#### 🔥 Tip: Click “More info → Run anyway” to start the calculator.

### 🧠 Why It Exists

Because learning Python shouldn’t be boring —
and calculators shouldn’t be this rude lol.
